# Mozzart Traffic Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates network traffic captured from the Mozzart game to create an offline replay of game states. By using this, you can observe game outcomes faster than real-time gameplay without interacting with the server.

## Features
- Offline replay of captured WebSocket traffic.
- Sandbox environment for JavaScript execution.
- Customizable replay speed.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install fs jsdom
