Problem: //my code 1.3.0.3-rev-3-final has been placing losing bets//
ChatGPT:The code snippet provided attempts to automate betting, but there are issues with the logic and execution of bets, particularly causing losses. Here are key recommendations and fixes:

1. Validate Betting Logic:
Problem:
Your calculateBetAmount function may be generating bets that are either too high, too low, or unsuitable for the game state.

Solution:
Adjust bet calculations based on realistic game data.
Ensure multipliers and round status are correctly tracked before placing bets.
``see betCalc.js`` GC

2. Check Round Status Before Betting:
Problem:
Bets may be placed during the wrong game phase (e.g., after the multiplier starts increasing).

Solution:
Verify the game state (e.g., "WAITING FOR NEXT ROUND") before interacting.
``see roundCheck.js``

3. Fine-Tune Cashout Timing:
Problem:
Cashouts may occur too early or too late, leading to reduced profits or losses.

Solution:
Implement dynamic cashout based on live multiplier tracking:
``see cashOutTimer.js``

4. Improve Live Round Tracking:
Problem:
Multiplier tracking may be inaccurate or unreliable due to incorrect selectors or timing.

Solution:
Ensure accurate and continuous monitoring of game state and multiplier updates.
``see trackLiveRounds.js``

5. Debugging Losing Streaks:
Problem:
The script does not analyze why bets are failing.

Solution:
Log results after every round, including the final multiplier and the cashout multiplier.
Adapt strategies dynamically based on win/loss history.
``see analyzeResults.js``

6. Handle Long Browser Sessions Gracefully:
Keep the browser session active by periodically refreshing or revalidating the state.
Add error recovery mechanisms to handle iframe disconnection or navigation errors.
```javascript
setInterval(async () => {
    log('Performing periodic health check...');
    const pages = await browser.pages();
    if (!pages.length) {
        log('No active pages. Attempting recovery...');
        await navigateWithRetry(config.url, page);
    }
}, 600000); // Every 10 minutes
```
